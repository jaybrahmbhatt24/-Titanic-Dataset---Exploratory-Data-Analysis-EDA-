# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This notebook focuses on understanding the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations.

## Covered:
- Summary Statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Histograms and Boxplots for numeric features
- Correlation Matrix and Heatmap
- Feature relationships using Pairplot
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly

## Tools Used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Interview Preparation ðŸŽ¯

- **Purpose of EDA:** Understand the data before modeling.
- **Boxplots:** Detect outliers and visualize distributions.
- **Correlation:** Measures relationship between features; helps feature selection.
- **Detect Skewness:** Using histograms/KDE plots.
- **Multicollinearity:** High correlation between independent variables (bad for models).
- **Tools for EDA:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly.
- **EDA Finding Problems:** Missing values, anomalies, skewed distributions.
- **Role of Visualization in ML:** Makes feature engineering and model building easier by revealing patterns.
